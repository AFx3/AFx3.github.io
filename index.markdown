title: About

---
I am a first-year PhD student at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, enrolled in the Systems Science PhD program with a focus on software quality. I am part of the SySMA research unit.

My research interests lie in formal methods and language-based technologies for security. My current work centers on static analysis techniques for detecting bugs in the cross-language scenario.
