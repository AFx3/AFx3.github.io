# About

I am a first-year PhD student at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, enrolled in the Systems Science PhD program, software quality track.  
I am part of the SySMA research unit.

My research interests lie in formal methods and software security. My current work centers on static analysis techniques for detecting bugs in multi-language software. In particular, Rust programs interacting with C/C++ or legacy code in general.
